//! ================================= Deployment Strategies in Node.js =================================

// When deploying a Node.js application, several strategies can be used based on the complexity of your application,
// the environment, and performance requirements. Choosing the right strategy ensures that your application remains
// scalable, reliable, and secure. Below are the common deployment strategies for Node.js applications.

// Subtopics and Details:
//? Single Server Deployment
//? Horizontal Scaling
//? Load Balancing
//? Zero Downtime Deployment
//? Rolling Deployments
//? Blue-Green Deployment
//? Canary Deployment
//? Using Docker for Deployment
//? CI/CD Pipeline
//? Environment Management
//? Using Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
//? Monitoring and Logging

//? 1. Single Server Deployment
// This is the most basic form of deployment where the Node.js application is deployed on a single server.

//* Advantages: Simple to set up and manage.
//* Disadvantages: Not scalable and susceptible to failure if the server goes down.
//* Use Cases: Small-scale applications, internal tools.

// 1. Install Node.js on the server.
// 2. Upload your application code.
// 3. Run the application using a process manager like `pm2`.

//! pm2 start app.js

//? 2. Horizontal Scaling
// Node.js applications can be horizontally scaled by deploying multiple instances of the application
// across several servers or CPUs. This strategy allows the application to handle a larger number of requests.

//* Advantages: Increases the capacity of your application by adding more instances.
//* Disadvantages: More complex setup, requires load balancing.
//* Use Cases: Applications with high traffic and complex workloads.

// - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic between multiple Node.js instances.
// - Deploy multiple instances on different machines or containers.

//? 3. Load Balancing
// In a load balancing strategy, incoming traffic is distributed across multiple instances of your application
// to ensure efficient resource utilization and high availability.

//* - Reverse Proxy: Using tools like NGINX or HAProxy to forward requests to your Node.js servers.
//* - Cloud Load Balancers: Services like AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Google Cloud Load Balancing.
{
  // Example (NGINX as Load Balancer):
  ```nginx
upstream app_cluster {
    server 127.0.0.1:3000;
    server 127.0.0.1:3001;
    server 127.0.0.1:3002;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://app_cluster;
    }
}
```;
}

//? 4. Zero Downtime Deployment
// Zero downtime deployment ensures that the application is available for users without interruptions,
// even during updates or maintenance. This is especially important for critical applications.

//* Process Managers: Use `pm2` with cluster mode or services like Kubernetes to ensure that updates do not cause downtime.
//* Blue-Green Deployments: Alternate between two environments (blue and green) to achieve zero downtime.

//? 5. Rolling Deployments
// Rolling deployment gradually updates instances of your application one by one. This ensures that a portion
// of your application remains live, while another portion is being updated.

//* Advantages: Updates are gradual and prevent the risk of full-scale failures.
//* Disadvantages: If not managed well, partial outages can affect users.

// If you have 10 instances, update 2 at a time while the other 8 continue to serve traffic.
// Use a load balancer to manage routing.

//? 6. Blue-Green Deployment
// In a blue-green deployment, two environments are used: one currently serving production traffic (blue)
// and one being prepared with updates (green). When the green environment is ready, traffic is switched to it.

//* Advantages: Quick rollback if an issue occurs in the new environment.
//* Disadvantages: Requires double the resources (two environments).

// - Deploy your updated application to the green environment.
// - Test the green environment.
// - If successful, route traffic from blue to green.

//? 7. Canary Deployment
// Canary deployment allows deploying a new version of your application to a small subset of users first.
// If the deployment is stable, it can gradually be rolled out to all users.

//* Advantages: Minimizes the risk of deploying new features by limiting exposure.
//* Disadvantages: Requires monitoring tools to ensure stability.

// - Deploy the new version of your app to 10% of the servers initially.
// - If no issues arise, deploy to the remaining 90%.

//? 8. Using Docker for Deployment
// Docker allows you to containerize your Node.js application, making it easier to deploy and run across
// various environments. Containers ensure that the application behaves consistently, regardless of where it's deployed.

//* Advantages: Consistent environment, portability.
//* Disadvantages: Requires learning Docker, setup can be complex initially.
{
  // Example (Dockerfile for Node.js App):
  ```dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```;
}

//! 1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   ```//! 2. Run the container:
```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
   ```;

//? 9. CI/CD Pipeline
// A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying your
// Node.js application. Popular tools for CI/CD include Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI.

//* Continuous Integration (CI: Automates testing and integration of code changes.
//* Continuous Deployment (CD: Automates deployment to staging or production environments.
{
  // Example (GitHub Actions for Node.js):
  ```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```;
}

//? 10. Environment Management
// Environment management ensures that your Node.js application can run in different environments
// (development, testing, production) without manual changes. This involves using environment variables
// and configuration management tools.

//* `.env` files: Store environment-specific variables.
//* Tools: Use tools like `dotenv` for loading environment variables.

// Example (`dotenv` Setup):

//! 1. Install `dotenv`:
```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```//! 2. Use `.env` file for configuration:
```env
   PORT=3000
   DB_HOST=localhost
   ```//! 3. Load variables in the app:
```js
   require('dotenv').config();
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   ```;

//? 11. Using Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
// You can deploy your Node.js application to cloud platforms such as **AWS**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**,
// or **Microsoft Azure**. These platforms provide services like virtual machines, load balancers, and managed databases.

//* AWS Elastic Beanstalk: A PaaS for deploying and managing Node.js apps.
//* GCP App Engine: Managed services for Node.js deployment.
//* Azure App Service: A fully managed platform for deploying apps.

//? 12. Monitoring and Logging
// Once your Node.js application is deployed, monitoring and logging are essential for ensuring its health
// and performance. Tools like **PM2**, **New Relic**, **Datadog**, and **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
// can help with this.

//* Error Tracking: Use tools like Sentry to track errors and exceptions.
//* Logging: Use libraries like `winston` or `morgan` to log requests and errors.
{
  // Example (Logging with `winston`):
  const winston = require("winston");
  const logger = winston.createLogger({
    level: "info",
    format: winston.format.json(),
    transports: [
      new winston.transports.File({ filename: "error.log", level: "error" }),
      new winston.transports.File({ filename: "combined.log" }),
    ],
  });
}
